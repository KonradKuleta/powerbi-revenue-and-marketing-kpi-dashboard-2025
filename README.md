- How efficient are **paid (non-organic)** channels (ROAS, CPA, CAC, AOV)?
- Which products drive revenue concentration?

## KPI scope (important)
Efficiency KPIs (**ROAS, CPA, CAC, AOV**) are calculated for **Paid / Non-Organic channels** (Organic excluded)
(e.g., Paid Search, Paid Social, Email, Affiliate).  
Overall revenue visuals include **all channels** unless stated otherwise.
